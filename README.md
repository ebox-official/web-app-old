## Angular compiler version

This project was generated with Angular CLI version 12.2.0.

## Package manager and installation

## Launch locally

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Make a component

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Compile

Run `ng build --output-path app --base-href /app/`. The build artifacts will be stored in the `app/`. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

If you want to compile for GH pages run `ng build --output-path docs --base-href /web-app/`, for development `--configuration development`. Then go in the `docs/`, make a copy of index.html are rename it into 404.html.
